## Introduction

Steller is a modern E-Commerce store aimed at providing users with a seamless shopping experience. The platform is built using the latest web technologies, offering fast and responsive user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered applications. It provides benefits like improved performance, SEO optimization, and server-side rendering out of the box.

## Development Process

### Brainstorming

The development of the Steller E-Commerce Store followed a structured process. The initial stage involved brainstorming and planning the project. Key tasks in this stage included:

- Defining the scope and features of the application.
- Creating wireframes and mockups of the user interface.
- Designing the user flow and navigation.

### Implementation

With the plan in place, the implementation phase began. The following steps were undertaken:

1. **Setting Up Next.js**: Initialized a Next.js project using the command line tools. Created pages, components, and styles directories.

2. **Implementing UI with Tailwind CSS**: Designed and implemented responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS classes. Ensured a visually appealing and mobile-friendly layout.

3. **State Management with Zustand**: Utilized Zustand to manage the application's state, including cart items, user preferences, and more. The decision to use Zustand over Redux was driven by its simplicity and performance benefits.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features of the Steller E-Commerce Store:

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to provide an optimal experience across devices and screen sizes.
- **Fast Performance:** Next.js ensures speedy page loads, and optimized code improves the overall performance of the application.
- **Efficient State Management:** Zustand provides a streamlined and efficient approach to managing application state, avoiding the complexity often associated with Redux.
- **Seamless Shopping:** Users can easily browse products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases with a user-friendly interface.
- **Flexible Styling:** Tailwind CSS offers a versatile and customizable styling approach, making it easy to create a consistent and visually pleasing design.

## Future Plans

### Database Integration

In the future, Steller E-Commerce Store plans to integrate a database to store product information, user data, and order history. This will enable seamless management of products and improve user experience.
